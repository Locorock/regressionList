ygopro csv collection to edopro banlist converter

Basically you just run the python script with the .csv of your collection (from the collection manager on ygoprodeck) as an argument, like this:
python collectionToBanlist.py ./collection.csv
And the thing is going to output a collection.conf file that you have to slap in your fllist folder in edopro
